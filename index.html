        <h2>LOREM IPSUM</h2>
        <p>
            'Lorem ipsum' is a made-up phrase designed to resemble Latin. It's been used by typographers for
             <br/>several decades as a way to fill blank spaces and draw viewers' eyes towards a website's 
             layout rather <br/>than its text.It's common for viewers to be distracted by text when viewing 
             the design of a page, so using <br/>some made-up nonsense is an easier way to focus attention on 
             the desired page elements rather than its readable words.<br/> This is why it's more common to see
             the phrase in the world of design, type-setting and publishing.

            We plan to set up at least 100 Makerspace by 2030 in line with our SDG Goals.
